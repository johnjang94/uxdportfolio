      The project's target audience was the medical professionals regardless of their age, region or country. The user research was conducted by sending out Google forms to the contacts that TeleVU Innovations Inc. had as well as inviting a few medical professionals to live interview via Zoom.
      During the interview, we have had an opportunity to ask some questions regarding their engagement in using the smart technology during the treatment sessions.<br/>
      <br/>
      In this research, we have had about 8 participants whose titles vary from nurse to physician and whose ages ranged between 20s to 50s.

      Reflection
    </h1>
    <p class="reflect">
      Looking back on this project, I have learned an essential lesson and showed other teammates regarding the importance of the research. Most of the time, my teammates and I have been working asynchronously other than the team meetings. Therefore, it was vital to have clear records in order to keep everyone on the track. <br/>If any of the teammates did not leave any note regarding the work, we came to understand that it could become difficult to track down the work.<br/><br/>

      This project has also shown me the importance of following the process in UX design, particularly empathizing with users, <br/>as this is critical in order to avoid designing to one's taste rather than the user's needs. It also taught me the value of usability testing and iteration because we have noticed that the design <br/>did not leave the same message to every participant <br/>when we assessed how much each participant has understood what they see from the design.<br/>
      <br/>
      Overall, what I have learned from this project is that no creation <br/>can be silly.
      Everyone has different ideas and it is our job to work together to find out what idea suits the best of the customers' interests.
