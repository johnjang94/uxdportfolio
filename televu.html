    <h1>About the Project</h1>
    <p>
      This was a real-world project that was arranged by one of the accredited
      universities here in Toronto, Ontario, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, and my teammates and I
      were asked to redesign the existing product.

    <h1>Context & Background</h1>
    <p>
      TeleVU Innovations Inc. is a privately-owned telecommunication corporation
      that connects the clinicians and the patients on a remote-basis to reduce
      the wait times and to offer improved medical assistance.
      <br /><br />
      TeleVU Innovations Inc. offers two different products that are connected
      to each other. One of them is the access to the desktop website that
      clinicians can use to treat patients remotely.
      <br /><br />
      On Desktop website, the customers can sign-up, cancel, call another
      customer who use the same program, initiate a video-call, record a
      video-call (while in session) or review the recorded videos in history.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other product is the service in glasses which is wearable. This
      machine is usually provided to the guardians or nurses who can assist the
      patients.
      <br /><br />
      Similar to the Desktop website, the patient's guardian(s) or the
      nurse-in-charge can either dial or accept the call from clinicians who are
      calling them from the Desktop website.
