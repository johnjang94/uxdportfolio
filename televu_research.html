    <h1>Research</h1>
    <h3 class="difficulties">Addressed difficulties among users</h3>
    <p>
      In the beginning of the research phase, it came to the teamâ€™s attention
      that the clinicians were also seeking for a chance to provide the company
      a bit of feedback on the company's product. If there was anything, they
      were always overwhelmed with the number of patients which did not leave
      them a moment to speak up for themselves until we have reached out to
      them.
    </p>
    <h3>Assumptions</h3>
    <p>
      In order to redesign the client's product that is efficient and usable, we
      needed to explore the client's product first. Once the exploration was
      completed, we have outlined our assumptions.
    </p>
    <li>Assumptions that the client had:</li>
    <br />
    <span>Original Video session window design</span><br />

      When we finished exploring the client's product and outlined all our
      assumptions, we have decided to conduct two different types of research:
      <li>interviews (both in-person and zoom)</li>
      <li>
        competitive platform analysis (by comparing the client's product to
        other well-established products)
      </li>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have conducted the interviews and compared the client's product to
      another well-known products for platform analysis as well as follows:
    </p>
    <br /><br />
    <span>Zoom Interview</span><br />

    />
    <p class="after">
      We have arranged different interview times and invited a few participants
      to explore their opinions.
      <br /><br />
      We have invited about 5 people to join us online

    />
    <p>
      We have conducted a comparative analysis onanother brand to examine how an
      established telecommunication platform offers different experience in
      comparison to the client's product

      Once all the interviews were completed, we have began going through every
