    <h1>Research</h1>
    <h3 class="difficulties">Addressed difficulties among users</h3>
    <p>
      In the beginning of the research phase, it came to the teamâ€™s attention
      that the clinicians were also seeking for a chance to provide the company
      a bit of feedback on the company's product. If there was anything, they
      were always overwhelmed with the number of patients which did not leave
      them a moment to speak up for themselves until we have reached out to
      them.
    </p>
    <h3>Assumptions</h3>
    <p>
      In order to redesign the client's product that is efficient and usable, we
      needed to explore the client's product first. Once the exploration was
      completed, we have outlined our assumptions.
    </p>
    <li>Assumptions that the client had:</li>
    <br />
    <span>Original Video session window design</span><br />

      When we finished exploring the client's product and outlined all our
      assumptions, we have decided to conduct two different types of research:
      <li>interviews (both in-person and zoom)</li>
      <li>
        competitive platform analysis (by comparing the client's product to
        other well-established products)
      </li>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have conducted the interviews and compared the client's product to
      another well-known products for platform analysis as well as follows:
    </p>
    <br /><br />
    <span>Zoom Interview</span><br />

    <p class="after">
      We have arranged different interview times and invited a few participants
      to explore their opinions.
      <br /><br />
      We have invited about 5 people to join us online

      We have conducted a comparative analysis onanother brand to examine how an

            <span class="learned1">Q. What did we learn?</span><br /><br />
            A. My team and I have learned that the login process was not as
            confusing to the clinicians who were interested in using the
            service. In fact, the client offers tutorial to the customers before
            the customers can practically use the service; therefore, the
            clinicians understand how to login.<br /><br />
            On the other hand, the client's customers still did not like the
            fact that the login was in two-steps. Basically, they felt that it
            was not necessary to click the "Sign in with another organization"
            button if they were still supposed to write their login id and
            password in the following screen. They said that one-step login
            process will do.

      Navigation Menu
      <li>
        It was difficult to navigate from one menu to another for the clinicians
        whilst they tried to engage with the product because the product was not
        interactive enough.
      </li>

            Fact:<br /><br />
            Unlike what we had assumed, the client's customers did not encounter
            as much difficulty in navigating through the menus due to the
            tutorial. On the other hand, they still admitted that it takes time
            to be familiar with the menu names.

      Video-Conference Session

        Many clinicians complained that the controls were not straight-clear.

            <span class="learned1">Q. What did we learn?</span><br /><br />
            The client's customers have confirmed that the buttons need to be
            re-organized. Since they already knew that one layer of menu is
            meant to control the Desktop PC and the other layer of menu is for
            the mobile screen that's also displayed on the Desktop PC, they were
            getting used to the controls. However, they have mentioned that
            there needs to be some work done in organization.

            The clinicians only wanted to be able to modify and custom-save the
            recorded videos that are from the previous sessions.
