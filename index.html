        <p class="televu_intro">
          TeleVU Innovations Inc. is a telecommunication corporation that connects the clinicians and the patients on a remote-basis to reduce the wait times and to offer sooner medical assistance as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p class="televu_intro">
          TeleVU Innovations Inc. offers two different products that are connected to each other.
          One is the access to the desktop website. This is usually given to the clinicians. They can talk to the other clinicians or directly to the patients while using the desktop PC. While using the website on the desktop PC, you can call other clinicians, patients, take screenshots during the remote session, record the remote session, replay the recorded videos for later-use, and control the smart glasses as needed.

            The other product is the service in glasses. The glasses are called the Smart Glass. It is just like a pair of glasses that you can use every day (if you ever wear the glasses), but it has a special communication feature being built-in the glasses itself. It feels like you are the Iron Man, but instead of using the helmet to talk to others, you are using the glasses. These smart glasses are usually used by the frontline clinicians such as Emergency Response Team, nurses or guardians who directly interact with the patients to provide the care.

        This was a real-world project that was arranged by one of the accredited universities here in Toronto.<br/><br/>
        The client, for this project, is the CEO of TeleVU Innovations Inc. and we were requested to re-design a product that already exists to make it better.

        <p>As a team of designers, we had the responsibility to make the user experience for this web portal better. Although the primary responsibility and the major point of this project was focused on the video-conference session window, the client had asked us to expand our capability to the entire web portal if possible. In this project, he has not asked specifically anything on revising an existing feature or creating a new feature on the mobile environment for the smart glasses, so we needed to find out where the issues are arising from only based on the web portal.<br/><br/>
        My team and I needed to conduct a qualitative and a quantitative research to recruit appropriate participants to hear their opinions, but before that, we needed to know what we are offering the participants for a test. Therefore, we had conducted the test to explore the tools on our own first. </p>

            besides the smart glasses themselves) was located on the top of the

            It was clear that some of the icons were similar in functions and

            priorities nor the industry convention were not respected when those
            features were first created and been implemented.

            The clinicians could click on each menu. When the names for each
            menu were confusing, there was no description on what the clinicians
            can do on each page. My team and I assumed that this would even
            delay their time in reaching out the patients because they need to
            know how to use the tool first, and it is possible that they might
            need to spend a significant number of hours just to get their feet
            wet first.

            From the main nagivation page, a couple of pages displayed lists of
            smart glasses devices that were associated with a particular
            clinician's account. In some ways, the people could check some level
            of information regarding the device. On the other hand, not all the
            information was clear to us other than the names of each device and
            to whom the devices belong to or in the possession of.

            From the information, we were able to notice that there was a button

            it was unclear how to initiate the call from the Desktop PC because
            we couldn't understand when the button is activated and ready for
            the call or not. From here, we have assumed that some of the
            clinicians might as well just give up on using the product.

            not actually be useful to the clinicians because the history page
            does not contain the practically useful information prior to
            treating a patient.

                My team and I have learnt that the login process was not as
                confusing to the clinicians who were interested in using the
                service. In fact, the client offers tutorial to the customers
                before the customers can practically use the service; therefore,
                the clinicians understand how to login.<br /><br />
                
                On the other hand, the client's customers still did not like the
                fact that the login was in two-steps. Basically, they felt that it
                was not necessary to click the "Sign in with another organization"
                button if they were still supposed to write their login id and
                password in the following screen. They said that one-step login
                process will do.

        <br/>
      While creating the user persona and the user journey map, we needed to think about the design.
      We did not want to simply draw on a white board but thought of design that accommodates the following considerations:

    </div>
    <div class="consideration">
      <ol style="width: 1000px; margin-top: 30px; color: blue;">Point 1 I Convenience based on Frequency</ol>
      <li>
        From the meetings with the client, we have understood that the client wanted a major change on the video-conference session window. Those changes needed to accommodate what the customers wanted to see while they were in the calling session. <br/><br/>
        
        From the research, we have understood that the video session was not convenient to use. Therefore, we have constantly asked each other what it means to feel "convenient", especially for the client's product.<br/><br/>
        
        Considering the results of competitive analysis, we have reached the conclusion that the features that is most used needs to be located in a place of the web page screen where it is well-spotted.
      </li>
      <ol style="margin-top: 30px; color: blue;">Point 2 I Ease on Navigation</ol>
      <li>
        My team and I believed that it is important to remind the users regarding what they can do after they complete a task, especially if the task is a part of a series of actions.
      </li>
      <ol style="margin-top: 50px; color: blue;">Point 3 I Interactivity</ol>
      <li>
        Last but not least, my teammates and I have also continuously asked how we can make the product to be more engaging to the clinicians who use the client's product and let them know what they are doing if they decided to do anything. For example, if a clinician clicks "call" button, the product should at least notify the clinician that it is loading the video-calling session.

        My teammates and I believed that all these changes will improve the way that the clinicians use the product and will make them feel pleased to use the features more frequently than the past.
        However, we needed to know that what we've intended was working as we've intended to be. In order to find out, we have decided to put it to a test.

      From the user-testing phase, we were confirmed that things were working as we have intended them to be, and we were very pleased to see the outcome.<br/>
      <br/>
      Looking back to this project, I feel that not a single phase was easy to me. On the first day that my teammates and I were scheduled to have the first meeting with the client, I was scared and nervous to meet the client or talk about this project even though I was not the only one to feel that way. However, as the project progresses, we've learnt that the client was such a gentleman who has communicated with us very well and was understanding.<br/><br/>

      The next challenge was the research phase.<br/>
      It was not easy to recruit the participants as the majority were busy clinicians afterall.
      We were not sure if we could arrange an interview with them and were also told that it has become very difficult to get a hold of any of them due to the situation in the clinics or in the hospitals.
      Still, we did not give up but have decided to send out questions to whoever was available to respond. In fact, we have ended up interviewing some medical students, too.<br/><br/>

      Last challenge was the teamwork.<br/>
      Since we were all working asynchronously other than gathering up for team mmeting or meeting with our client, the progress were slow at times or we were at risk to lose the track of who did what.
      To prevent this, we've kept our work on a design program called Figma, Google Spreadsheet, Google Excel, and Miro altogether.
      We left messages and comments using Discord platform as well to keep each other up to date.<br/><br/>

      The entire course-work demanded a huge amount of work in such short amount of time. On the other hand, I was very happy to see that a) the redesign worked out very well, b) my teammates and the client have understood the importance of the research, and c) I have learned some valuable designing tools such as Figma.

    <h1 class="finalnote">Final Note</h1>
    <p class="finalnote_points">
      If there is anything that I wish things were better:
    </p>
      <li class="finalnote_point_detail">
        I still feel that it was unfortunate for us to miss the chance to learn further regarding the client company's business structure.
      </li>
      <li class="finalnote_point_detail finalnote_point_detail1">
        I still hope that he allows some tiny changes such as modifting the titles for videos that are saved to the history section after the users are finished with recording the session for the convenience of the users, if the client chooses to work with another team of designers in the next opportunity.
